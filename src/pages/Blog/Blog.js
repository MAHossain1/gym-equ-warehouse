        3. What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work
      </h2>
      <p>
        {" "}
        <b>Answer: </b>
        JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security
        information between two parties â€” a client and a server. The
        authentication server verifies the credentials and issues a JWT signed
        using a private key. Moving forward, the client will use the JWT to
        access protected resources by passing the JWT in the HTTP Authorization
        header. The resource server then verifies the authenticity of the token
        using the public key.
